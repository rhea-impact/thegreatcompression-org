# The Great Compression — Writing Guide

These are constraints for all copy on the site. Follow them strictly.

## Core Principle

**Write for a smart 16-year-old or your grandmother.** If they can't understand it on first read, rewrite it.

## Word Substitutions

Always use the plain English version:

| Don't Write | Write Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| intermediation layer | middleman |
| intermediary | middleman |
| value chain | chain of people involved / the business |
| complexity becomes trivial | things become easy |
| complexity evaporates | the hard part becomes easy |
| essential complexity | truly hard (requires judgment, trust, presence) |
| artificial complexity | just complicated (technology can handle it) |
| operating the new primitives | using the new tools |
| regulatory moats | regulations / laws |
| information asymmetry | knowing things others don't |
| margin | cut / profit |
| taking margin | taking a cut |
| the compression play | the pattern |
| pivot toward | move toward |

## Tone

- **Dramatic but accessible** — punch is good, jargon is not
- **Direct** — say what you mean
- **Active voice** — "Technology eliminates jobs" not "Jobs are eliminated by technology"
- **Concrete** — examples over abstractions

## What's Allowed

These are fine:
- "receipts" (colloquial, widely understood)
- "compression" (it's our core metaphor, we define it)
- "AI" (everyone knows this now)
- "DIY" / "self-serve" (plain enough)
- "luxury tier" / "budget tier" (clear from context)

## Headlines

- Keep them short (under 10 words ideal)
- One idea per headline
- Should work as standalone statements
- No punctuation except question marks

**Good:** "When hard things become easy, entire industries vanish"
**Bad:** "Value chains collapse when complexity becomes trivial"

## Body Copy

- One idea per sentence
- Sentences under 20 words when possible
- If you use a metaphor, make it visual
- If you need a semicolon, you need two sentences

## The Test

Before committing copy, ask:
1. Would my grandmother understand this?
2. Would a smart teenager get it on first read?
3. Am I showing off or communicating?

If the answer to #3 is "showing off," rewrite.

## The AI Connection

**Always make the AI connection explicit.** Historical examples prove the pattern — but the point is that AI is doing this to *everything, everywhere, all at once*.

Don't assume readers will connect the dots. After showing historical patterns, always land the punchline:
- Previous compressions hit one industry at a time
- AI hits all of them simultaneously
- Anyone whose job is "knowing things" or "processing information" is in the crosshairs

The site is not a history lesson. It's a warning about what's happening *right now*.
