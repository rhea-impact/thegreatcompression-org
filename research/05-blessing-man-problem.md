# The Blessing Man Problem: What Happens to Displaced Workers

## Origin of the Term

In medieval times, a "blessing man" was a priest who blessed ships before voyages. When ships stopped sinking as often (better construction, navigation), the blessing man's value proposition collapsed—not because blessings stopped, but because **the fear that made them valuable diminished**.

## The Pattern

When technology compresses an industry, workers face three possible fates:

### 1. Transition (Best Case)
Skills transfer to the new technology or adjacent field.

**Examples**:
- Telegraph operators → Telephone operators
- Human computers (NASA) → Computer programmers
- Typesetters → Desktop publishing specialists

**Characteristics**:
- Core skill remains valuable
- Learning curve is manageable
- Worker has time to adapt

### 2. Displacement (Common Case)
Skills become worthless; worker must start over.

**Examples**:
- Travel agents → ??? (most left industry entirely)
- Blockbuster clerks → ??? (retail, gig economy)
- Switchboard operators → ??? (general clerical work)

**Characteristics**:
- Core skill no longer needed
- New skills require significant retraining
- Often accompanied by wage decrease

### 3. Elimination (Worst Case)
Entire category of human labor becomes unnecessary.

**Examples**:
- Elevator operators → Fully automated
- Bowling pin setters → Fully automated
- Lamplighters → Fully automated

**Characteristics**:
- No transition path
- Technology is 100% substitute
- Role becomes historical curiosity

## The "Just Learn to Code" Fallacy

### The Myth
"Workers displaced by technology can just learn new skills"

### The Reality

**Age matters**:
- Average age of travel agent in 2000: 47 years old
- Average age of Kodak employee at bankruptcy: 52 years old
- Retraining success rates drop significantly after age 45

**Geographic matters**:
- Factory town loses factory → No local jobs to transition to
- Kodak was Rochester, NY's largest employer
- Blockbuster closures hit small towns hardest

**Time matters**:
- Phase 2 of sigmoid is 5-15 years
- Retraining for new career: 2-4 years minimum
- By the time workers retrain, the new field may also be compressing

## Historical Wage Impact

| Disruption | Immediate Wage Impact | 10-Year Impact |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Hand weavers (1800s) | -58% wages | Permanent decline |
| Auto workers (1970s) | -20% (union protected) | -40% (outsourcing) |
| Travel agents (2000s) | -30% (survivors) | -50% |
| Newspaper journalists (2010s) | -35% | -50% |

**Pattern**: Survivors of compression earn less, even if they keep their jobs.

## The "Luxury Tier" Escape

Some displaced workers survive by **moving upmarket**:

| Mass Market (Compressed) | Luxury Tier (Survives) |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Travel booking (Expedia) | Luxury travel advisors |
| Stock trading (Robinhood) | Wealth management |
| Photography (smartphones) | Professional photographers |
| Clothing (fast fashion) | Bespoke tailors |

**Key insight**: The luxury tier survives because:
1. Clients pay for **human attention**, not just output
2. Status signaling ("I have a guy")
3. Complexity that algorithms can't handle (yet)

## The AI Compression: Who's at Risk?

### High Risk (Blessing Man territory)
- Customer service representatives
- Data entry clerks
- Basic legal/accounting work
- Content moderation
- Translation (commodity)
- Basic writing/copywriting

### Medium Risk (Transition possible)
- Software developers (low-level coding)
- Graphic designers (template work)
- Financial analysts (routine analysis)
- Radiologists (initial reads)

### Lower Risk (Luxury tier)
- Complex litigation
- Executive strategy
- Creative direction
- Relationship-based sales
- Craft/artisan work

## Policy Implications

Historical responses to compression:

1. **Luddism** - Destroy the machines (failed)
2. **Unions** - Slow the transition (temporary)
3. **Retraining programs** - Mixed results
4. **Social safety nets** - Necessary but insufficient
5. **UBI proposals** - Untested at scale

**The uncomfortable truth**: No society has successfully managed rapid compression without significant social disruption.
