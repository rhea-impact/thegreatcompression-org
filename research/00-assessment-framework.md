## Scoring Criteria (1-10 each)

### 1. VISCERAL IMPACT
How emotionally resonant is this story?
- Does the reader feel something?
- Is there a human face to the compression?
- Can people picture the before/after?

### 2. DATA QUALITY
How solid are the numbers?
- Do we have peak employment figures?
- Do we have timeline data?
- Can we cite authoritative sources?

### 3. CULTURAL FAMILIARITY
Will readers recognize this?
- Is it a household name (Kodak, Blockbuster)?

- Are there confounding factors?

### 5. HISTORICAL BALANCE
Does it help our era diversity?
- Pre-1900 (Industrial Revolution)

## Data Gaps to Fill

For each Top 10, we need:

### Quantitative Data
- [ ] Peak employment/revenue figures
- [ ] Timeline: When did compression start/end?
- [ ] Compression ratio: Before vs. After
- [ ] What replaced it? Employment at replacement?

### Qualitative Data
- [ ] Key quotes from era (newspapers, executives, workers)
- [ ] Cultural artifacts (ads, news clips, photos)
- [ ] The "denial moment" - when did incumbents realize?
- [ ] Who survived? How?

### Images Needed
- [ ] "Peak" era photo (before compression)
- [ ] The disruptive technology
- [ ] The aftermath (empty stores, bankruptcy headlines)

## Priority Research Queue

### Tier 1: Best Stories (Most Data Needed)
1. Blockbuster - Need store count by year, Netflix timeline
2. Travel Agents - Need BLS data, booking % shift
3. Kodak - Need employee count by year, bankruptcy docs
4. Switchboard Operators - Need BLS historical data

### Tier 2: Strong Stories (Some Data Gaps)
5. Record Stores - Need Tower Records timeline
6. Carriage Industry - Need company count data
7. Encyclopedias - Need Britannica sales data
8. Stock Brokers - Need commission compression data

### Tier 3: Supporting Stories (Good Enough)
9. Elevator Operators - Anecdotal is fine
10. Human Computers - Hidden Figures gives us narrative
