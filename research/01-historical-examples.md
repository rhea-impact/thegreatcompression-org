# Compression Examples Research (1863-Present)

## Criteria for Valid Examples

A compression example is valid if the technology **truly eliminated** the job category, not just shifted workers to similar roles.

## Rejected Examples (Job Shift, Not Elimination)

| Claimed Example | Why Rejected |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **Telegraph → Telephone Operators** | Skills transferred; became telephone operators |
| **Bank Tellers + ATMs** | Employment actually *increased* after ATMs |
| **Secretaries** | Role evolved into "executive assistant" |
| **Farm Workers** | Shifted to other sectors; total employment grew |

## Key Patterns

1. **50-year transitions**: Horse→car took 50 years; weaving took 65 years
2. **Initial pain, long-term growth**: Typesetters initially lost 60-80%, but total employment later grew
3. **Pre-internet pattern**: Switchboard, elevators, pinsetters prove this isn't just "internet killed jobs"
4. **Irony factor**: Kodak invented what killed them; Blockbuster passed on buying Netflix
