# Disintermediation Studies: Academic Literature Review

## Definition

**Disintermediation**: The removal of intermediaries from a supply chain—"cutting out the middlemen"—allowing producers and consumers to connect directly.

Term originated in **1967** in banking (consumers investing directly in securities rather than savings accounts) and expanded to technology/e-commerce in the **1980s-90s**.

## Key Academic Studies

### 1. Bakos (1991, 1998) - Electronic Marketplaces

**Publication**: "The Emerging Role of Electronic Marketplaces on the Internet" - Communications of the ACM

**Hypothesis**: Internet-based electronic marketplaces would directly match buyers and sellers with lower transaction costs, creating "friction-free" markets and eliminating intermediaries.

**Actual Finding**: Markets don't necessarily become disintermediated. Electronic marketplaces may actually *reinforce* intermediary roles by enabling new types of bundled offerings.

### 2. Bailey & Bakos (1997) - Electronic Intermediaries

**Publication**: International Journal of Electronic Commerce, Vol. 1, No. 3

**Method**: 13 case studies of firms in electronic commerce

**Key Finding**: "Markets do not necessarily become disintermediated as they become facilitated by information technology."

**New Roles Identified**:
1. Aggregating products/services
2. Matching suppliers and customers
3. Providing trust
4. Providing market information

**Examples**: BargainFinder (failed), Firefly (succeeded)

### 3. Giaglis, Klein, O'Keefe (1999) - The IDR Cycle

**Publication**: Electronic Markets journal

**Framework**: Intermediation → Disintermediation → Reintermediation (IDR) Cycle

**Three Scenarios**:
1. **Disintermediation** - Traditional intermediaries driven out
2. **Reintermediation** - Traditional intermediaries adapt and leverage expertise
3. **Cybermediation** - New digital-native intermediaries emerge

**Conclusion**: Complete disintermediation "is not something that can be expected in the near future"

### 4. Grace Gu (2024) - Management Science

**Publication**: "Technology and Disintermediation in Online Marketplaces"

**Finding**: Restricting alternative communication technology reduces disintermediation by ~18%

**Key Insight**: Disintermediation is greater for:
- Time-sensitive jobs
- Communication-intensive jobs
- High-skilled jobs

## What Actually Happened

### The Prediction (1990s)
"The internet will eliminate middlemen"

### The Reality
**New intermediaries replaced old ones**:

| Old Intermediary | New Intermediary |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Travel agents | Expedia, Kayak, Google Flights |
| Retail stores | Amazon |
| Classified ads | Craigslist, Indeed |
| Stock brokers | E*Trade, Robinhood |
| Record stores | iTunes, Spotify |
| Video stores | Netflix |

### Why Pure Disintermediation Often Failed

1. **Economies of intermediation** - Manufacturers have scale in production, not distribution
2. **Trust requirements** - New intermediaries provide payment protection, reviews, dispute resolution
3. **Search costs** - Aggregation creates value (one-stop shopping)
4. **Levi Strauss example** - Failed at direct sales despite heavy investment

## Implications for "The Great Compression"

### The Nuance
Disintermediation doesn't *eliminate* all middlemen—it **compresses** which middlemen are needed:

- **Before**: Many layers (manufacturer → distributor → wholesaler → retailer → consumer)
- **After**: Fewer layers (manufacturer → platform → consumer)

### The Job Impact
Even with reintermediation, **total employment in intermediary roles drops**:
- Amazon employs warehouse workers, not retail salespeople
- Expedia employs engineers, not travel agents
- The new intermediary needs **fewer humans per transaction**

### Key Insight for Thesis
The pattern isn't "technology eliminates middlemen"—it's:
> **"Technology compresses the number of humans needed to intermediate"**

This is more intellectually honest than pure "disintermediation" claims.
