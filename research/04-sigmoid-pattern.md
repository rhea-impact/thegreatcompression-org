# The Sigmoid Pattern: How Compressions Unfold

## The Universal Shape of Disruption

Every compression follows a **sigmoid curve** (S-curve):

```

         Slow → Fast → Slow
```

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: "It's a Toy" (Slow Start)
- New technology dismissed by incumbents
- Early adopters are hobbyists/enthusiasts
- Existing workers feel secure

**Examples**:
- "The telephone is a toy" - Western Union, 1876
- "No one will want a computer in their home" - DEC, 1977
- "Netflix is a niche mail-order service" - Blockbuster, 2000

### Phase 2: "Oh No" (Rapid Compression)
- Technology crosses usefulness threshold
- Adoption accelerates exponentially
- Mass job displacement occurs
- Incumbents scramble (usually too late)

**Timeline**: Often just 5-15 years at the steep part of the curve

**Examples**:
- Switchboard operators: 1960-1980
- Film photography: 2000-2010
- Video rental: 2007-2013
- Travel agents: 1998-2010

### Phase 3: "The New Normal" (Plateau)
- Technology is ubiquitous
- Remaining human roles are specialized/luxury
- New equilibrium established

## Historical Sigmoid Timelines

| Industry | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Total |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Hand weaving | 1785-1810 | 1810-1840 | 1840-1880 | ~95 years |
| Horse transport | 1886-1910 | 1910-1930 | 1930-1950 | ~65 years |
| Switchboards | 1920-1960 | 1960-1980 | 1980-2000 | ~80 years |
| Film photography | 1975-1995 | 1995-2010 | 2010-2015 | ~40 years |
| Video rental | 1997-2005 | 2005-2012 | 2012-2014 | ~17 years |
| Travel agents | 1995-2000 | 2000-2010 | 2010-present | ~15 years |

**Key observation**: The sigmoid is getting **steeper and shorter** over time.

## The Denial Gradient

Workers in Phase 1 and early Phase 2 consistently underestimate disruption:

| Statement | Who Said It | What Happened |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| "The internet is a fad" | Newsweek, 1995 | Newspapers lost 70% ad revenue |
| "Amazon is just a bookstore" | Barnes & Noble, 1999 | B&N bankrupt 2019 |
| "People want physical media" | Blockbuster CEO, 2008 | Blockbuster bankrupt 2010 |
| "AI can't do creative work" | Many, 2022 | ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc. |

## Predicting Where We Are on the Curve

### Signs of Phase 1:
- Incumbents dismissive
- Technology requires technical expertise
- Limited mainstream awareness
- "That'll never work"

### Signs of Phase 2:
- Rapid user growth (>50% YoY)
- Incumbents launching competing products
- Layoffs begin in traditional sector
- "Okay but it's not as good as..."

### Signs of Phase 3:
- Technology is default choice
- Remaining human service is premium/luxury
- New generation doesn't remember old way
- "Wait, people used to do that?"

## Where is AI on the Curve?

**Current indicators suggest**: Late Phase 1 / Early Phase 2

- ChatGPT: Fastest growing consumer app ever (Phase 2 indicator)
- Most knowledge workers: "It's useful but I still need to check its work" (Phase 1 attitude)
- Major layoffs beginning in tech, media, customer service (Phase 2 indicator)
- Incumbents scrambling to add AI features (Phase 2 indicator)

**Estimated timeline to Phase 3**: 5-15 years for most knowledge work

## The Compression Accelerates

Why each sigmoid is shorter than the last:

1. **Network effects** - More connected world = faster adoption
2. **Capital mobility** - Investment shifts quickly to winners
3. **Consumer expectations** - People expect instant, free, convenient
4. **Building on previous waves** - Each technology leverages prior infrastructure

The Great Compression isn't just about AI—it's about the **acceleration of the acceleration**.
