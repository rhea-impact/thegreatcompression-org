# The Compression Ratio: Quantifying Human Displacement

## Core Thesis

Every technological disruption has a **compression ratio**—the number of human workers replaced per unit of output.

This is more precise than "disintermediation" because it acknowledges that:
1. Intermediaries don't disappear—they compress
2. The work still gets done—by fewer people
3. The pattern is measurable and predictable

## Historical Compression Ratios

| Technology | Before | After | Ratio |
|------------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Power Loom (1785)** | 10-20 weavers | 1 operator | 10-20:1 |
| **Linotype (1886)** | 6 typesetters | 1 operator | 6:1 |
| **Ford Assembly Line (1913)** | 12 hours/car | 1.5 hours/car | 8:1 (time) |
| **Direct Dial (1920s-80s)** | 350,000 operators | ~0 | ∞:1 |
| **ATM (1970s)** | 1 teller per transaction | Self-service | Variable* |
| **Online Booking (1990s)** | 124,000 travel agents | Algorithms | ~20:1 |
| **Streaming (2007)** | 9,000 stores, 84,000 employees | ~5,000 Netflix engineers | ~17:1 |

*ATMs are a counterexample—branches expanded, tellers increased. BUT the ratio of tellers-to-transactions compressed dramatically.

## The Compression Formula

```
Compression Ratio = (Workers Before) / (Workers After)
                    for equivalent output
```

### Example: Travel Industry

**1996 Baseline**:
- 124,000 travel agents
- ~500 million domestic flights/year
- Ratio: 1 agent per 4,000 bookings/year

**2024 Reality**:
- ~15,000 travel agents remain
- ~900 million domestic flights/year
- Ratio: 1 agent per 60,000 bookings/year

**Compression**: 15x fewer humans per booking

## Why "Compression" Not "Elimination"

### The Reintermediation Trap

Academic research (Bakos, Giaglis) shows middlemen don't disappear—they transform:

| Old Middleman | New Middleman | Compression |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Travel agent | Expedia engineer | 1000:1 |
| Retail clerk | Amazon warehouse worker | 10:1 |
| Stock broker | Robinhood server | 10000:1 |
| Video store clerk | Netflix algorithm | ∞:1 |

### The Key Insight

The **transaction still requires intermediation**:
- Someone aggregates options
- Someone provides trust
- Someone handles logistics

But technology compresses **how many humans** are needed to do it.

## Compression Accelerates Over Time

### First Wave: Mechanical (1800s)
- Power looms, assembly lines
- Compression ratio: 5-20:1
- Timeline: 50-100 years to full adoption

### Second Wave: Electrical/Electronic (1900s)
- Switchboards, elevators, typewriters
- Compression ratio: 10-100:1
- Timeline: 20-50 years

### Third Wave: Digital (1990s-2020s)
- Internet, e-commerce, streaming
- Compression ratio: 100-10,000:1
- Timeline: 5-20 years

### Fourth Wave: AI (2020s+)
- LLMs, autonomous agents
- Compression ratio: **???**
- Timeline: **???**

## Implications

1. **Job "creation" is misleading** - New jobs are created, but at lower ratios
2. **Productivity gains accrue to capital** - Fewer workers share the output value
3. **The pattern is accelerating** - Each wave compresses faster than the last
4. **AI is the ultimate compression** - Software that writes software

## Research Questions

1. What is the typical compression ratio for AI tools in knowledge work?
2. Is there a "floor" to compression (minimum humans needed)?
3. How does compression ratio correlate with wage impact?
4. What industries have the highest compression potential?
