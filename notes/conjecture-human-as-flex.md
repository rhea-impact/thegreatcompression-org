# Conjecture: Human Help as the New Flex

*February 2026*

## The Sigmoid Compression

Value chain compression doesn't eliminate jobs binary-style. It compresses across the sigmoid:

```
Before compression:
[============================] 100% of market served by humans

After compression:
[==]..........................  ~10% still wants human help
    ^                         ^
    |                         |
    Premium tier              Mass market → AI
```

The job title persists. The addressable market collapses. "Travel agents still exist" is true but misleading — 50% of jobs gone, 70% of bookings now online, survivors clustered in luxury/complex niches.

## The Inversion of Scarcity

When human labor was abundant and AI didn't exist:
- Human service = default
- Automation = premium (novel, efficient, "high-tech")

When AI handles most cognitive tasks:
- AI service = default
- Human service = premium (scarce, status signal, "artisanal")

**Human help becomes the new flex.**

## Examples Already Emerging

| Domain | Mass Market (AI) | Luxury Tier (Human) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Food | Fast food, meal kits | "A person made my dinner" |
| Clothing | Off-the-rack, algorithmic recommendations | Bespoke tailor |
| Finance | Robo-advisor | "My financial advisor" |
| Tax | AI prep + $200 review | Full-service CPA relationship |
| Travel | Online booking | Human travel concierge |
| Writing | AI-generated content | "Written by a human" as selling point |

## Implications

1. **The premium tier may grow in value**: As human labor becomes scarcer in service roles, the wealthy pay MORE for it, not less. The market shrinks but price per unit rises.

2. **"Artisanal" spreads to knowledge work**: We already have "handcrafted" goods and "farm-to-table" food. Next: "human-written," "human-advised," "human-prepared."

3. **Status signaling shifts**: Showing you can afford human attention (not AI) becomes a class marker. "I have a person for that."

4. **The middle class gets compressed**: AI serves the mass market. Humans serve the wealthy. The middle — decent-but-not-premium human service — disappears.

## The Thesis Connection

This isn't a counterexample to compression. It's the **residual structure** after compression:

- Mass market: value chain collapses, AI captures (minimal) value
- Luxury market: humans remain, possibly capturing MORE value per transaction due to scarcity

The total value captured by humans drops dramatically. But it doesn't go to zero — it concentrates at the top percentile, reframed as premium/luxury/status.

## Open Questions

- At what income level does "human flex" kick in?
- Does this create a two-tier society more explicitly than today?
- Can "human-made" be faked/gamed like "organic" labels?
- Does the luxury tier grow fast enough to absorb displaced workers? (Probably not)
