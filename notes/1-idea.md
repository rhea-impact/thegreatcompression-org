# The Great Compression — Core Idea

*What we're communicating and why*

## The Thesis (One Sentence)

Technology compresses value chains. Regulation delays but doesn't prevent compression. Even when new complexity emerges, it captures far less value than what it replaced.

## What Makes Value Chains Vulnerable

Two types of complexity are vulnerable to compression:

1. **Information asymmetry**: Encyclopedias, phone books, stock brokers, travel agents — anyone who profits from knowing things others don't

2. **Cognitive complexity**: Tax prep, legal research, code generation — anyone who profits from doing thinking others can't

When technology eliminates the asymmetry or handles the cognition, the chain compresses.

## Key Messages (What Readers Should Understand)

### 1. The Sigmoid — Compression Isn't Binary

AI doesn't replace jobs in a step function. It compresses across a sigmoid:
- Mass market (80%) → AI handles it
- Premium tier (10-20%) → Humans remain as luxury/status
- **The middle disappears entirely**

The job title "exists" but the addressable market collapses.

**Why sigmoid-shaped?** The extremes persist because:
- Budget tier: Some customers always wanted self-serve (now AI-serve)
- Luxury tier: Scarcity creates value; human attention becomes status signal
- Middle: No defensible position — too expensive for budget, not exclusive enough for luxury

### 2. The "Blessing Man" Pattern

The professional doesn't disappear — they get pushed to a final-check role:

```
BEFORE:  Client → Professional (does the work) → Output
         $1,000-$2,000 for labor + expertise

AFTER:   Client → AI (does the work) → Professional (blesses it) → Output
         $200-$250 for stamp + liability shield
```

The credential retains value. The labor doesn't. The professional becomes a "blessing man" — reviews, signs, takes liability. Still employed. Capturing 10% of original value.

**Examples happening now:**
- CPA: $2,000 tax prep → $200 review (projected 2025-2028)
- Estate attorney: $1,000-$3,000 → $200-$400 (projected 2025-2030)
- Journalism: 75,000 newsroom jobs (2006) → 24,000 (2024) — already realized

### 3. Value Capture Collapses (80-99% gone)

| Before | After | Value Captured |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Telegram: per-word charges | Email: free | ~99% gone |
| Encyclopedia ($1,400/set) | Wikipedia ($0) | 100% gone |
| Stock broker ($50/trade) | Robinhood ($0) | 100% gone |
| Long distance ($1+/min) | VoIP (fractions of penny) | ~99% gone |
| Kodak (145,300 employees) | Post-bankruptcy (5,400) | 96% gone |

New intermediaries capture *something*, but a fraction of the old chain.

### 4. Human Help Becomes the Status Signal

Post-compression, scarcity inverts:
- When AI is default, human service = **luxury signal for the wealthy**
- "A person made my dinner" = status
- "My accountant" (not "I use AI") = flex
- "Human-written" becomes a selling point

This isn't a counterexample to compression — it's the **residual premium** after compression. The mass market evaporates; what remains is reframed as luxury.

**Open question:** Does the luxury tier grow fast enough to absorb displaced workers? Probably not.

### 5. Regulation Delays, Doesn't Prevent

Industries that resist compression share heavy regulation:

| Industry | Compression Status | Regulatory Friction |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Publishing, telecom | Compressed | Low |
| Stock trading | Compressed | Medium (deregulated over time) |
| Tax preparation | Compressing slowly | High (CPA requirements, IRS approval) |
| Legal (estate planning) | Compressing slowly | High (UPL rules, bar associations) |
| Healthcare | Resistant | Very high |

**What resists compression:**
- Regulatory protection (car dealers: zero compression due to state franchise laws)
- Essential complexity (commercial insurance: 87% still through agents)
- Relationship/trust requirements (wealth management)
- Physical presence requirements (notarization, some legal)

### 6. Capitalism's Dual Role

**Accelerator**: Capital actively seeks disintermediation — that's where returns live. VCs fund compression plays.

**Brake**: Incumbents delay compression when threatened:
- Lobbying for protective regulation
- Artificial complexity (proprietary formats, lock-in)
- Subscriptions vs. ownership
- "Safety" concerns that double as regulatory capture

**The cloud vs. local tension**: Cloud AI = recurring revenue = delayed compression. Local AI = one-time event = full compression. Capitalism will push toward subscriptions.

### 7. Compression Accelerates Over Time

Each compression happens faster than the last:
- Telegraph → telephone: ~100 years
- Newspapers → internet: ~20 years
- Record stores → streaming: ~10 years
- Stock commissions → zero: ~5 years once started

## The Emotional Arc (What Readers Should Feel)

1. **Recognition**: "Oh, I know this pattern — telegrams, encyclopedias, record stores"
2. **Connection**: "This is happening to tax prep, legal, journalism right now"
3. **Clarity**: "The sigmoid explains why 'jobs still exist' doesn't mean 'no compression'"
4. **Discomfort**: "Is the complexity I manage essential or artificial?"
5. **Hope/Agency**: "I can pivot toward essential complexity or operating the new primitives"

## Implications (What To Do About It)

### For Workers
If your job is managing artificial complexity, the compression clock is ticking. Pivot toward:
- **Essential complexity**: Relationships, judgment, trust, physical presence
- **Operating the new primitives**: Someone needs to build/run the AI systems

### For Investors
The compression play is obvious in hindsight but hard to time:
- Regulatory moats delay but don't prevent
- Value capture in the new regime is always lower than expected
- Watch for: AI-native startups with professional networks for "blessing"

### For Incumbents
Lobbying buys time but not safety. The choice:
- Compress yourself (cannibalize margins)
- Be compressed by others

### For Society
Each compression frees resources for the next expansion. The question is who captures the freed value — and whether it's broadly distributed or concentrated.

## The Uncomfortable Question (Closing)

For anyone in a value chain: **Is the complexity you're managing essential or artificial?**

- **Essential**: Regulatory requirements (not lobby-created), physical constraints, trust relationships, safety-critical decisions
- **Artificial**: Information asymmetry that technology can eliminate, cognitive work that AI can perform

If it's artificial, compression is coming. Regulation may delay it. Capitalism may slow it. But the pattern holds.

## What This Site Is NOT

- Not a prediction of specific timelines (though research suggests ranges)
- Not anti-technology or anti-AI
- Not claiming all jobs disappear (sigmoid preserves extremes)
- Not investment advice
- Not ignoring compression-resistant industries (we'll show what resists and why)

## Open Questions (Intellectual Honesty)

- At what income level does "human flex" kick in?
- Does this create a two-tier society more explicitly than today?
- Can "human-made" be faked/gamed like "organic" labels?
- Does the luxury tier grow fast enough to absorb displaced workers? (Probably not)

## Success Criteria

A reader who spends 5 minutes on the site should:
1. Understand the sigmoid (compression isn't binary)
2. Remember "human help is the new flex"
3. Know the "blessing man" pattern
4. Be able to explain the thesis to someone else
5. Ask themselves the uncomfortable question
6. Have a sense of what to do about it
