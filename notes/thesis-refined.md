# The Great Compression: Refined Thesis

*Developed through dialogue, February 2026*

## Core Thesis

Technology expands with complexity, then collapses under its own weight to a few primitives, which compress the value chain. Then the cycle repeats with the next technology expansion.

## Refined Thesis (v2)

**Technology compresses value chains. Regulation delays but doesn't prevent compression. Even when new complexity emerges, it captures far less value than what it replaced.**

## Key Mechanisms

### 1. The Compression Pattern

Value chains built on two types of complexity are vulnerable:

- **Information asymmetry**: Encyclopedias, phone books, stock brokers — anyone who profits from knowing things others don't
- **Cognitive complexity**: Tax prep, legal research, code generation — anyone who profits from doing thinking others can't

When technology eliminates the asymmetry or handles the cognition, the chain compresses.

### 2. Regulation as Friction

Industries that resist compression share a common trait: heavy regulation.

| Industry | Compression Status | Regulatory Friction |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Publishing | Compressed | Low |
| Telecom (messaging) | Compressed | Low |
| Stock trading | Compressed | Medium (but deregulated over time) |
| Tax preparation | Compressing slowly | High (CPA requirements, IRS approval) |
| Healthcare | Resistant | Very high |
| Nuclear | Resistant | Very high |
| Aviation | Resistant | Very high |

Regulation doesn't prevent compression forever — it delays and fatigues it.

### 3. Value Capture Collapses

Even when new complexity emerges post-compression, it captures *far less value* than the old chain:

| Before | After | Value Captured |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Telegram: per-word charges | Email: free | ~99% gone |
| Encyclopedia Britannica: $1,400/set | Wikipedia: $0 | 100% gone |
| Long distance: $1+/minute | VoIP: fractions of a penny | ~99% gone |
| Stock broker: $50/trade | Robinhood: $0/trade | 100% gone |
| Tax prep: $2,000 engagement | AI + review: $200 | ~90% gone (projected) |

New intermediaries (Mailchimp, Salesforce, etc.) capture *something*, but it's a fraction of what the old chain extracted.

### 4. Capitalism's Dual Role

**Accelerator**: Capital actively seeks disintermediation because that's where returns live. VCs fund compression plays. The profit motive is the *engine* of compression.

**Brake**: Capitalism also delays compression when incumbents are threatened:

- Lobbying for protective regulation (taxi medallions, CPA requirements, licensing)
- Artificial complexity (proprietary formats, lock-in, subscription vs. ownership)
- Acquiring and killing competitors
- "Safety" concerns that double as regulatory capture
- Pushing for licensing requirements that favor compliance-heavy incumbents

**In AI specifically**: The cloud vs. local tension. Cloud AI = recurring revenue = delayed compression. Local AI = one-time event = full compression. Capitalism will push toward subscriptions and "AI-as-a-service" to slow the compression that local models enable.

## The Uncomfortable Question

For anyone in a value chain: **Is the complexity you're managing essential or artificial?**

- **Essential complexity**: Regulatory requirements, physical constraints, trust relationships, safety-critical decisions
- **Artificial complexity**: Information asymmetry that technology can eliminate, cognitive work that AI can perform

If it's artificial, compression is coming. Regulation may delay it. Capitalism may slow it. But the pattern holds.

## Implications

1. **For workers**: If your job is managing artificial complexity, the compression clock is ticking. Pivot toward essential complexity (relationships, judgment, trust) or toward operating the new primitives.

2. **For investors**: The compression play is obvious in hindsight but hard to time. Regulatory moats delay but don't prevent. Value capture in the new regime is always lower than expected.

3. **For incumbents**: Lobbying buys time but not safety. The choice is to compress yourself (cannibalize margins) or be compressed by others.

4. **For society**: Each compression frees resources for the next expansion. The question is who captures the freed value — and whether it's broadly distributed or concentrated.
