## The Meta-Pattern

### What Compresses
1. **Information asymmetry** eliminated by technology
2. **Commoditized, standardized** products/services
3. **High volume, low complexity** transactions
4. **Physical infrastructure** replaced by digital

### What Resists
1. **Regulatory protection** (car dealers, some real estate)
2. **Essential complexity** (commercial insurance, complex tax)
3. **Relationship/trust** requirements (wealth management)
4. **Physical presence** requirements (notarization, some legal)

### Compression Timing
- Telegraph → telephone: **~100 years** (slow)
- Newspapers → internet: **~20 years** (medium)
- Record stores → streaming: **~10 years** (fast)
- Stock commissions → zero: **~5 years** once started

### Value Capture Pattern
Every compression follows the same arc:
1. New technology emerges
2. Incumbents dismiss or fail to adapt
3. Rapid adoption creates tipping point
4. **80-99% of value evaporates** from old chain
5. Remaining value concentrates in premium tier or new platforms
