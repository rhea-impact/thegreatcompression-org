# The Great Compression

Website for [thegreatcompression.org](https://thegreatcompression.org) - exploring how AI compresses business value chains.

## Concept

Every intermediation layer exists because of complexity. When AI removes that complexity, entire value chains collapse:

| Industry | Era | Disruptor | Result |
|----------|-----|-----------|--------|
| Phone Books | 1990s-2000s | Search Engines | $14B/yr → $0 |
| Encyclopedias | 2000s | Wikipedia | $650M/yr → discontinued |
| Telegrams | 1990s-2000s | Email/SMS | Western Union → dead 2006 |
| Physical Mail | 2000s-2020s | Digital | Volume down 47% |
| Tax Prep | 2020s | Local AI | ~90% cost reduction |

**"You don't disrupt one company. You evaporate the entire reason the chain existed."**

## Stack

TBD - React component ready, needs hosting setup.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `value-chain-collapse.jsx` | Interactive React component showing before/after value chains |

## Design

- Dark theme (#0a0a14 background)
- Playfair Display (headings) + DM Sans/Mono (body)
- Expandable accordion cards
- Before/after toggle with animations
- Grid pattern background
