# Sal the Salesperson: The Tax Prep Value Chain

## The Story

Imagine Sal, a salesperson for Snowflake. He sells databases to Thomson Reuters. Thomson Reuters also buys Tableau from Salesforce so they can visualize Snowflake. And then of course Thomson Reuters delivers these visualized insights and data to a tax accounting firm with 4,500 clients of different sizes, helps to sell them a larger software package that helps their employees to complete tax returns.

That's an entire value chain collapsed by AI when the AI on your computer just does 90% of your tax prep for you, and the accountant is just a blessing-man.

## Analysis

This is a really sharp observation, and it's one most people in enterprise software are still in denial about.

You've mapped out a chain with at least four or five layers of value extraction that all exist because of information asymmetry and complexity:

1. **Snowflake** sells storage and compute to Thomson Reuters
2. **Salesforce** sells Tableau so TR can make that data legible
3. **Thomson Reuters** packages those insights into products and compliance tools
4. **The accounting firm** buys those tools to arm 4,500 client-facing accountants
5. **The accountants** use all of it to do what is, honestly, a largely deterministic task — applying tax code to financial data

Every single one of those layers takes a margin. Every layer adds friction, sales cycles, implementation consultants, license negotiations, training, support tickets. Sal the Snowflake rep exists because the complexity of the stack justifies a human to navigate it.

## The Collapse

But when a local model on your laptop can ingest your W-2s, 1099s, brokerage statements, and mortgage docs, cross-reference them against current tax code, and produce a nearly complete return in minutes — the entire chain doesn't just get disrupted. **It gets irrelevant.**

- You don't need Tableau to visualize what the AI just explained to you in plain English
- You don't need Thomson Reuters to package tax logic that's already embedded in the model
- You don't need the firm's software suite when the AI *is* the suite

The accountant becomes, as you said, a **blessing-man**. A final check, a signature, a professional liability shield. Which is still valuable — but it's a $200 review, not a $2,000 engagement. And that one shift in the terminal node cascades backward and hollows out every upstream layer.

## The Uncomfortable Question

The uncomfortable question for everyone in that chain is: **what are you actually selling when the complexity you were hired to manage just... evaporates?**

Sal isn't really selling a database. He's selling a piece of a complexity stack that only makes sense when humans need elaborate tooling to do cognitive work. Once they don't, the whole thing unwinds.

## The Meta-Pattern

This is what people miss about AI disruption. It's not about any one product getting replaced. It's about **entire value chains of intermediation losing their reason to exist simultaneously**.
