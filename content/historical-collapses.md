# Historical Value Chain Collapses

The meta-pattern is always the same: **complexity creates intermediaries, each intermediary extracts margin, and then a technology makes the complexity trivial.** The chain doesn't get disrupted — it gets obviated.

Nobody disrupted the telegram by building a better telegram. They made the concept of paying per word to send a message absurd.

## Printing Press (1440s)

**Before:** Monks hand-copying manuscripts → scriptoriums → church-controlled distribution → limited literacy

**After:** Gutenberg collapsed the entire knowledge gatekeeping chain. Suddenly you didn't need a monastery to produce a book or the Church's permission to read one.

## Refrigeration & Railroads (1880s–1920s)

**Before:** Local slaughterhouses → ice harvesters → salt curers → local butchers → seasonal eating

**After:** Mechanical refrigeration and refrigerated rail cars collapsed the entire preservation and distribution chain. Gustavus Swift basically killed thousands of local meatpacking operations overnight. You no longer needed to live near your food source.

## Container Shipping (1956+)

**Before:** Individual longshoremen → break-bulk cargo handling → warehouse-by-warehouse sorting → local port monopolies

**After:** Malcolm McLean's standardized container eliminated an entire labor ecosystem. Loading a ship went from a week to hours. Ports like New York that couldn't adapt died while places like Newark and Singapore exploded.

## ATMs & Online Banking (1970s–2000s)

**Before:** Bank tellers → branch managers → physical ledgers → armored cash transport → check clearing houses

**After:** Each layer employed thousands. Now your phone does what used to require walking into a building during banker's hours and talking to three people.

## Digital Photography (2000s)

This one is brutal.

**Before:** Film chemists at Kodak → film manufacturing plants → retail photo counters → photo processing labs → print paper suppliers → photo album manufacturers

**After:** A twelve-layer value chain collapsed into your phone's camera app. Kodak had 145,000 employees at peak. The entire chemical film supply chain simply ceased to exist.

## Streaming Music (2000s–2010s)

**Before:** Artists → recording studios → mixing engineers → CD pressing plants → distributors → record store chains → radio promoters

**After:** Tower Records, Sam Goody, the entire physical distribution chain — gone. A kid with a laptop and Spotify for Artists now bypasses every single one of those layers.

## GPS Navigation (2000s)

**Before:** Cartographers → survey teams → printing companies → retail distribution → gas station map racks → AAA TripTik routing services

**After:** An entire industry of people whose job was knowing where things are, rendered irrelevant by a satellite constellation and a free app.

---

## Ride-Sharing (2010s)

**Before:** Taxi medallion authorities → dispatch centers → fleet maintenance companies → medallion lenders (some medallions cost $1M+) → radio dispatch infrastructure

**After:** Uber collapsed the medallion-industrial complex. The dispatching layer alone employed thousands of people whose entire job was matching riders to drivers by radio.

## 3D Printing (emerging)

This one's still unfolding.

**Before:** Design firms → tooling manufacturers → injection mold makers → overseas factories → container shipping → customs brokers → wholesale distributors → retail

**After:** For certain products, a CAD file and a printer collapses that entire chain to your desk.

## AI & Knowledge Work (2020s)

That's what's happening now with AI across knowledge work. It's not making better enterprise software. **It's making the need for enterprise software absurd in a growing number of domains.**
