# /tighten

Cut the fluff. Make content lean and punchy.

## When to Use
- When a section feels bloated
- When paragraphs ramble
- Before final review

## Instructions

Apply these cuts in order:

### 1. Kill Weasel Words
Remove or replace:
- "very", "really", "quite", "somewhat"
- "in order to" → "to"
- "it is important to note that" → cut entirely
- "the fact that" → cut entirely
- "basically", "essentially", "fundamentally"

### 2. Cut Throat-Clearing
First sentences that don't add information:
- "As we've discussed..."
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "One might argue that..."
- "At the end of the day..."

### 3. Compress Redundancy
- Two sentences saying the same thing? Pick the better one.
- Three examples? Two is usually enough.
- Repeating the point in different words? Stop.

### 4. Activate Passive Voice
- "Value was compressed by AI" → "AI compressed value"
- "Jobs were eliminated" → "Companies eliminated jobs"

### 5. Show, Don't Explain
If showing + explaining the same thing:
- Keep the example
- Cut the explanation (or cut it to one line)
