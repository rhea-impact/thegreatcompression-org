# /review-narrative

Review the narrative flow and emotional arc of the site content.

## When to Use
- After adding or changing sections
- When content feels disjointed
- To validate the story builds properly

## Instructions

Read through the site in order (idea doc, spec, then App.tsx sections) and evaluate:

### 1. Emotional Arc
Check the progression follows the intended pattern:
- **Hook** (Section 1-2): Dissonance, "something is wrong"
- **Historical Context** (Section 3-4): "This has happened before"
- **The Model** (Section 5-6): Understanding, "ah, now I see"
- **Deep Dive** (Section 7-10): Specifics that validate
- **Implications** (Section 11-12): What this means for them
- **Resolution** (Section 13-14): Agency, next steps

### 2. Transitions
Each section should:
- Answer a question the previous section raised
- Raise a new question for the next section
- Never feel like a non-sequitur

### 3. Pacing
- Are we front-loading too much complexity?
- Is there breathing room between dense sections?
- Do dramatic moments have space to land?

### 4. Consistency
- Does terminology stay consistent?
- Are metaphors carried through or abandoned?
- Does the "voice" stay steady?
