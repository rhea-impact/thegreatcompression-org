# /punch

Make a section hit harder. Turn mild observations into gut punches.

## When to Use
- Section feels flat or academic
- Key insight isn't landing
- Need more emotional impact

## Instructions

### 1. Find the Core Truth
What's the ONE thing this section is really saying? Strip away qualifications. Find the uncomfortable truth hiding behind polite language.

### 2. Lead with the Gut Punch
Don't build up to it. Hit them first, explain after.

**Before:** "Over time, the role of the accountant has evolved from strategic advisor to compliance checkbox, as software handles the analytical work."

**After:** "Your accountant used to think for you. Now they just sign."

### 3. Use Concrete Numbers
Abstract: "Significant job losses"
Concrete: "200,000 telegraph operators. Zero."

### 4. Make It Personal
Change "workers" to "you"
Change "the industry" to "your industry"
Change "people" to "you and everyone you know"

### 5. Use Short Sentences for Impact
Long sentence building context and explanation.
Then punch. Hard.

### 6. Find the "Wait, What?" Moment
Every punchy section needs one moment where the reader's brain stutters:
- A counterintuitive stat
- An unexpected comparison
- A reframe they didn't see coming

## Output Format

```markdown
## Punching Up: [Section Name]

### Current Impact Level
[1-5 scale, with reason]

### The Core Truth
[One brutal sentence]

### Rewritten Section
[New version]

### Key Punches Added

### New Impact Level

```

## Warning
Don't punch everything. Save it for:
- The opener
- Key insights
- The call to action
- Statistics that matter

Over-punching feels try-hard. Under-punching feels boring.
